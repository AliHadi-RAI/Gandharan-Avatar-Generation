**Gandhara‐Style Narrative Generator**  
📖 Overview

The **Gandhara Project** implements a Python‑based “wrap‑up” agent that transforms simple prompts into rich, classical Gandharan‐style narratives. Leveraging large language models on a Google Colab GPU environment, it expands user prompts into detailed scene descriptions, crafts character backstories inspired by Gandharan art and history, and produces cohesive story‐style summaries that blend factual recap with cultural flair.

📂 Project Structure

- **Gandhara_Project.ipynb**  
  The main Colab notebook containing all code, examples, and step‑by‑step instructions.  
- **config.yaml**  
  Style and tone settings (e.g. pacing, historical references, language richness).  
- **requirements.txt**  
  List of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.  
- **scripts/**  
  Helper modules (e.g. `prompt_expander.py`, `backstory_generator.py`).  


🛠 Features

- **Prompt Expansion**  
  Enriches a brief user prompt into a vivid, detailed scene.  
- **Character Backstory Generation**  
  Crafts nuanced backstories with cultural and historical allusions.  
- **GPU‐Accelerated Inference**  
  Runs end‑to‑end generation on Colab’s free GPU for faster results.  
- **Configurable Style**  
  Control tone, pacing, and reference depth via `config.yaml`.  
- **Exportable Outputs**  
  Download final narratives as PDF, HTML, or plain text.
